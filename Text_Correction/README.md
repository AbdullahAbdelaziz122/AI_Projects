# Text Correction Model

This project involves a text correction model built using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is designed to correct grammar and spelling errors in text input.

## Overview

The text correction model uses a pre-trained T5 model fine-tuned on a dataset tailored for grammar and spelling correction tasks. The model takes a sentence with potential grammatical or spelling errors and outputs a corrected version of the sentence.

### Key Features

- **Grammar Correction**: Corrects grammatical mistakes in sentences.
- **Spelling Correction**: Fixes spelling errors within the text.
- **Pre-trained T5**: Utilizes the T5 model for robust language understanding and generation.

### Model Use Cases

- **Writing Assistance**: Helps improve the quality of writing by suggesting corrections.
- **Educational Tools**: Assists in language learning by providing corrected versions of user inputs.
- **Automated Proofreading**: Can be integrated into applications for automated text proofreading and correction.

## How It Works

1. **Input Text**: The user provides a sentence or text passage with potential errors.
2. **Tokenization**: The input text is tokenized into a format suitable for the T5 model.
3. **Model Inference**: The tokenized input is passed through the model, which generates a corrected version of the text.
4. **Output Text**: The corrected text is decoded and presented to the user.

## Model Training

The model was fine-tuned on a dataset containing pairs of incorrect and correct sentences. Training was performed using the Hugging Face Transformers library with mixed precision to optimize performance.

## Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using the GLEU (Google-BLEU) score, which measures the accuracy of the corrections by comparing the model's output to the reference corrected text.

## Saving and Loading the Model

The model and tokenizer were saved after fine-tuning and can be loaded for inference in future use.
